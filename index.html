        <h3>Why Eat It?</h3>
        
            <p> Sure, cheese has some great nutritional benefits and it'll (probably) give you bones like Magnus Magnusson, but that's not really why we eat it, is it?</p> 
            <p>It just tastes so damn good!</p>

            <p>Here are some things we'll help you track:</p>

            <li>Taste comparisons</li>
            <li>How much you had</li>
            <li>What you ate it with</li>
            <li>Where you got it from</li>
